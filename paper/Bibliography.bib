Here, I discuss the orthogonal concept of change in relative abundances, which I refer to as shape change. To be logically consistent, a measure of the rate of shape change should be scaling invariant (have the same value for all data with the same vector of proportional change over a given time interval), but existing measures do not have this property. I derive a new, scaling invariant measure. I show that this new measure and existing measures of biodiversity change such as the Living Planet Index describe different aspects of dynamics. I show that neither body size nor environmental variability need affect the rate of shape change. I extend the measure to deal with colonizations and extinctions, using the surreal number system. I give examples using data on hoverflies in a garden in Leicester, UK, and the higher plant community of Surtsey. I hypothesize that phylogenetically restricted assemblages will show a higher proportion of size change than diverse communities.},

	abstract = {As threats to species continue to increase, precise and unbiased measures of the impact these pressures are having on global biodiversity are urgently needed. Some existing indicators of the status and trends of biodiversity largely rely on publicly available data from the scientific and grey literature, and are therefore prone to biases introduced through over-representation of well-studied groups and regions in monitoring schemes. This can give misleading estimates of biodiversity trends. Here, we report on an approach to tackle taxonomic and geographic bias in one such indicator (Living Planet Index) by accounting for the estimated number of species within biogeographical realms, and the relative diversity of species within them. Based on a proportionally weighted index, we estimate a global population decline in vertebrate species between 1970 and 2012 of 58\% rather than 20\% from an index with no proportional weighting. From this data set, comprising 14,152 populations of 3,706 species from 3,095 data sources, we also find that freshwater populations have declined by 81\%, marine populations by 36\%, and terrestrial populations by 38\% when using proportional weighting (compared to trends of -46\%, +12\% and +15\% respectively). These results not only show starker declines than previously estimated, but suggests that those species for which there is poorer data coverage may be declining more rapidly.},

	abstract = {The Northwest Atlantic cod stocks collapsed in the early 1990s and have yet to recover, despite the subsequent establishment of a continuing fishing moratorium. Efforts to understand the collapse and lack of recovery have so far focused mainly on the dynamics of commercially harvested species. Here, we use data from a 33-year scientific trawl survey to determine to which degree the signatures of the collapse and recovery of the cod are apparent in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the broader groundfish community. Over this 33-year period, the groundfish community experienced four phases of change: (i) a period of rapid, synchronous biomass collapse in most species, (ii) followed by a regime shift in community composition with a concomitant loss of functional diversity, (iii) followed in turn by periods of slow compositional recovery, and (iv) slow biomass growth. Our results demonstrate how a community-wide perspective can reveal new aspects of the dynamics of collapse and recovery unavailable from the analysis of individual species or a combination of a small number of species. Overall, we found evidence that such community-level signals should be useful for designing more effective management strategies to ensure the persistence of exploited marine ecosystems.},

	doi = {10.1101/522631},
	abstract = {Environmental factors may interact with internal rules of population regulation, sometimes perturbing systems to alternate dynamic states. Yet, pinpointing when state changes occur in naturally fluctuating populations is difficult. An analytical approach that can identify the timing and magnitude of such changes, or "regime shifts", would facilitate understanding of abrupt ecological transitions with potential to inform conservation and management of species. We developed a generalizable model, the "Regime Shift Detector", for identifying changes in the parameters of a simple density dependent model governing the temporal fluctuations of a population. The model is a tool comprised of a suite of functions for examining population time series data for the presence, location, and magnitude of parameter shifts. The model uses an iterative approach to fitting subsets of time series data, then ranks the fit of a particular break point combination using model selection and assigns a relative weight to each break. We examined the performance of this model with simulations and two case studies: the invasion of the multicolored Asian ladybeetle and the decline of the eastern monarch butterfly. We found that under low environmental/sampling noise, the break point sets selected by the Regime Shift Detector contained the true simulated breaks with 70-100\% accuracy, with the most complex parameterization conditions (i.e. time series with many break points) least likely to be detected by the model. The weighting tool generally assigned breaks intentionally placed in simulated data (i.e., true breaks) with weights averaging \&gt;0.8 and those due to sampling error (i.e., erroneous breaks) \&lt;0.2, although the absolute weights of true versus erroneous breaks found by the model varied somewhat with other simulation parameters. In our case study examining the invasion process of ladybeetles, the Regime Shift Detector identified shifts in population cycling associated with variation in prey availability. The shifts identified for the eastern monarch population were more ambiguous, but generally coincided with changing management practices affecting the availability of hostplants in their summer breeding grounds. The Regime Shift Detector identifies possible break points within time series data and quantifies the strength of evidence for each break point. When interpreted in the context of species biology, the Regime Shift Detector has the potential to aid management decisions and identify critical time periods related to species' dynamics. In an era of rapid global change, such tools can improve understanding of the conditions under which population dynamics shift to other states.},

It's basically a discrete analog of a metric of speed through phase space; starting from the first time point in window, see if the next time point is sufficiently far away to be a separate point in phase space, given measurement error. Do this for each point following the first, until you find the first point that's outside that bound. Then classify that point as state 2, and restart the procedure. So if population goes t1 = 0, t2= 1, t3 = 0, that would actually be treated as three states. Then count fraction of each state in the window, and measure rates of change between states as the ratio of probabilities of adjacent states.
I see a few... bigger problems with this approach. First off, there is no measure at all of the size of each jump. so a time series that looked like x(t1)=0, x(t2) = 10000, x(t3) = 1e6 would be classified as having the same number of state changes as one with x(t1)=0, x(t2)=1, x(t3)=2 as long as sd(x) is {\textless}0.5. Second, the series x(t) = 0,1,0,1, would have as many states as x(t) = 0,1,2,3. Third, "Fisher information" will always decrease with measurement error. More precise measurement = more states = more chance that the system is in one state per time point. This will also happen as the number of time series included goes up.},

	abstract = {This note provides a brief review of five analytical methods previously used or promoted for diagnosing regime shifts in marine ecosystems. The methods discussed are: (i) principal components analysis, (ii) compositing average standard deviates, (iii) autoregressive moving average and intervention analysis modeling, (iv) vector autoregressive process modeling, and (v) Fisher information. Assessments of the relative strengths and weaknesses for the different analytical approaches are also offered. Some of these methods are applied to a collection of fishery oceanographic time series for the N. Pacific to illustrate aspects of their relative utility and limitations for diagnosing regime shift behavior. One recommendation for future studies is to analyze biotic and abiotic time series separately in order to identify ecosystem state variables of interest and to better isolate ecosystem behaviors from other influences like environmental change. Methods that allow for quantitative assessments of the statistical significance of hypothesized regime shifts should be favored over those that do not. Analyses of especially large collections of time series may benefit from first using a data compression technique and then applying one of the methods that are more appropriate for just one or a small number of time series. Because of the difficulties in observing and adequately documenting many aspects of marine ecosystem variability, it is crucial that future research attempt to combine empirical studies of large marine ecosystems with theoretical and modeling studies of other systems for which the dynamics and predictability are better understood. With such a comparative approach it should be possible to refine conceptual and simulation models, while also identifying crucial gaps in existing observations.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that tropical forest and savanna could represent alternative stable states, implying critical transitions at tipping points in response to altered climate or other drivers. So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

	abstract = {We present a palynologic study of El Triunfo wetland (4°58′54.5″N and 75°19′55.8″W), located at 3834 m a.s.l. in the Central Cordillera of Colombia. Pollen and spores record, which spans for the past {\textasciitilde}1930 yr {BP}, shows that Páramo vegetation has been dominated by Poaceae, Asteraceae, Lycopodiaceae, and Ericaceae. The sub-Andean forest is characterized by Urticaceae and Acalypha (Euphorbiaceae), while the Andean forest by Quercus (Fagaceae), Hedyosmum (Chloranthaceae), and Weinmannia (Cunoniaceae). We observed that aquatic vegetation pollen such as Cyperaceae were abundant, indicating marsh conditions in most of the record. Cold and warm periods, inferred from Páramo and Andean forest elements, respectively, reveal that the warmest periods were registered at {\textasciitilde}1000 cal. yr {BP} ({\textasciitilde}{AD} 1016) (‘Medieval Climatic Optimum’) and in the last century, whereas the coldest ones around 1200 cal. yr {BP} ({AD} 831) and 650–150 cal. yr {BP} ({AD} 1368–1750) (‘Little Ice Age’). The pollen signal suggests that warm periods were dry and cold periods were wet. A comparison of these results with some localities of northwestern Colombia, the Caribbean, and South America was made, displaying variations that reflect regional and/or global climatic phenomena such as Intertropical Convergence Zone and the El Niño Southern Oscillation. In the past 50 years, the decrease in Quercus, Weinmannia and Clusia recovery and the increase in Rumex, Plantago, and Gunnera may reflect human impact derived from livestock, agriculture, and/or firewood. Volcanic events of variable magnitude have been identified with an apparent minimal effect on vegetation, reaching a maximum variation of about 10–15\% between the beginning and the end of a volcanic event.},
